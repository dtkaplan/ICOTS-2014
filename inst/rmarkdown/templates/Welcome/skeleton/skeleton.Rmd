    ## Using R Markdown

It can be helpful to work directly from the `.Rmd` file from the RStudio editor in class.  It provides a convenient place to store the commands you plan to use in class.

Press the "Knit HTML" button in the RStudio editor An HTML document will be create that contain the R commands, the output they generate, and any narrative you care to include.  (All of this text is narrative.)

How might you distribute notes and other files to your students?  There are several possibilities.  

For today, within the workshop, we will use a very simple tool called RPubs.

### Using RPubs

After compiling your document, look at it in the RStudio previewer.  There is a button labelled "Publish."  Push it!
