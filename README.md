Project MOSAIC Workshop at ICOTS-2014
==========

## Resources

### Document Templates

In the workshop, you will be editing .Rmd files.  We provide several "template" documents to get you started.

You can access these either by direct web access to the .Rmd template or by using the RStudio TEMPLATE feature.

#### Direct links

* Welcome.  The [RMD Template](inst/rmarkdown/templates/Welcome/skeleton/skeleton.Rmd) and a [compiled version](inst/rmarkdown/templates/Welcome/skeleton/skeleton.html)

#### RStudio TEMPLATE feature

First, install the package.  
```
require(devtools)
install_github("dtkaplan/ICOTS-2014")
```

When you want to open a template, use the File/New File/RMarkdown menu item and select "From Template."  The names of the available templates will be listed under `{ICOTS-2014}`.

### Sharing your Rmd results:

* Press the "Publish" button in the RStudio Previewer.
* Login to [RPubs](www.rpubs.org) as user `ICOTS-MOSAIC`.  You'll need the password, which has been written on the board.
* Fill in a description if you like. It's helpful if you **include your name** in the title.  This will make it easier to find documents.
